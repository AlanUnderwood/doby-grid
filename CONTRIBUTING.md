Bug Reports & Feature Requests
==========

Please submit bug reports, feature requests via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/globexdesigns/doby-grid/issues).

For bugs be sure to search existing issues first. Include steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, and include your browser and browser version.

Submitting Pull Requests
==========

Before you start coding, post to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/globexdesigns/doby-grid/issues) about the bug or feature you're thinking of working on, so you can get early feedback. We don't want you to do tons of work and then have to rewrite half of it!

Feel free to submit pull requests for bugs or new features. Please ensure to run your code through the JSLint params as defined at the top of the file.
